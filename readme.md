GhostPy- an Encryption and Decryption Tool

Using the cryptography module in Python, we will use an implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) called Fernet to encrypt data. 
I will use these methods on files and folder for  Encrypting and Decrypting.Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm.
 AES is the industry standard as of now as it allows 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit encryption.Symmetric encryption is very fast as compared to asymmetric encryption and are used in systems such as database system.
 Following is an online tool to generate AES encrypted password and decrypt AES encrypted password.It provides two mode of encryption and decryption ECB and CBC mode.
For more info on AES encryption visit this explanation on AES Encryption.A onlie ecryption decryption system using JavaScript where you can encrypt and decrypt your file. 
It uses cryptojs library where I included most of the popular encryption methods such as AES, DES, Blowfish and so on. 
I integrated some Hash functions as well which is very useful to check the integrity of any file.
